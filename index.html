			<h4>What is this?</h4>
			<p>The Homestuck Green Pages (THSGP) is a website dedicated to archiving and displaying both deprecated and still-running regional Homestuck groups. This ranges from city-wide cosplay groups, to state-wide networks of Homestucks, to groups hosting Homestuck gatherings for entire countries and with anywhere from 20 to 1500 members. Most of these groups were active in the older days of the Homestuck fandom circa 2011-2016. Some, however, have been active for over a decade, and others still have come around only in the past few years. Regardless of size, location, or longevity, THSGP is determined to archive them all.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>What if they don't want to be archived?</h4>
			<p>Then they won’t be. For both safety and privacy reasons, all active groups have been asked for permission before being displayed on this site and the leader of any group at any time, past or present, is welcome to request their group be taken off the site.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>I’m in one of these pictures and I don’t like it.</h4>
			<p>That's not a question.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>I’m in one of these pictures and I don’t like it?</h4>
			<p>Let us know using the provided contact information and we’ll either blur your face, find a replacement picture, or remove the picture altogether.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>I know of/run a group that isn’t on this list, how do I add it?</h4>
			<p>Please let us know using the provided contact information at the bottom of the page! We’d be happy to display your site on THSGP. However, we do have a couple of requirements for you to meet in order for us to feature your group:
			<ul>
				<li>Your group must have existed for at least a month.</li>
				<li>Your group must have at least 15 members.</li>
				<li>Your group must encompass a specific and reasonabily sized region in the world.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>What counts as reasonably sized?</h4>
			<p>For example, a group encompassing the entirety of the continental US probably wouldn’t be of a reasonable size so as to function as a regional Homestuck group. Conversely, a group encompassing only your neighborhood probably wouldn’t be large enough to garner the members required (but if you’re able to do so anyways, feel free to reach out!)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>How do I start a regional Homestuck group?</h4>
			<p>I’m glad you’re interested! As I, BattleblockB0ss (the creator of THSGP), currently run one of the largest still-active regional Homestuck groups (that I know of), I have some tips to offer:
			<ul>
				<li>Choose a reasonable area. The group I run, Calibornia Homestucks, started as Bay Area Homestucks. However, we (Calibornia Staff) quickly realized there are a hell of a lot of Homestucks in California, so after a month or two we expanded to the entirety of our state. While that made sense for our situation, the same might not be true for you, so consider what size you reasonably can/want to manage.</li>
				<li>Organize! Put together a couple of official spaces with clear rules and discussion spaces. Using Calibornia as an example again, the day I created our Discord server I made a set of rules for members to follow, and soon after created a channel list in our Discord. A few months later I put together a team of local fans to manage the Discord, a team to manage in-person events, and a team to manage our social media. This helped us stimulate interactions, keep an eye on bad actors and keep our IRL spaces safe for everyone.</li>
				<li>Go to conventions and local events. Our biggest pull as a group has been local conventions (such as FanimeCon, SacAnime, and Anime Los Angeles). Take charge and organize gatherings and/or panels, and consider printing out some business cards! You can get 500 of decent quality for $20 from Staples (if you’re in the US).</li>
				<li>Finally, and most importantly: put safety above anything else! IRL meetups hosted by regional Homestuck groups usually entail a lot of people of a variety of ages meeting for the first time. My strongest advice in this regard is to never condone a gathering with 3 or less people in attendance, especially if the attendees have a sizable age difference, and provide a clear avenue to report misconduct.</li>
			</ul>
			I think the best advice I can give you is not to force it! Putting effort into forming a group is one thing, but trying to force dynamics that just aren’t natural is another. Make sure everyone is having fun.

			<h4>This project is dumb and you are dumb.</h4>
			<p>That’s not a question. Also, I don’t care. You’re welcome to voice your own opinion about this project and we're always open to constructive criticism and suggestions, but if you plan on doing nothing but talk shit about us, do it somewhere else.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>This project is cool and you are cool! How can I help?</h4>
			<p>Thanks! If you’re interested in helping out, we’re always looking for more people to search the internet for new data. People with experience working with HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript are always appreciated, but the only skill you really need to contribute is knowing how to use Google.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>Can I provide a donation for the hosting service/[other reason]?</h4>
			<p>Not right now, no. If there’s interest I’ll consider putting up a Patreon or Ko-fi, but the maintenance of this website is completely free thanks to Github Pages!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>Can I make a similar project?</h4>
			<p>Of course! THSGP is open source, so feel free to use/adapt the project to your own needs, provided you supply the appropriate credit. Everything I’ve created for this project is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>Why does this have such a stupid name?</h4>
			<p>Well, the inspiration was the yellow pages from the phone book but green, because Homestuck. However, The Genesis Project shares the same initials as The Green Pages, so I added a “Homestuck” in the middle and now it just sounds kind of shitty. If you have a better idea feel free to suggest it!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>I have a suggestion! How do I suggest it?</h4>
			<p>Reach out to us via one of the platforms listed at the bottom of the page!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>There's an error/typo/bug! How do I fix it?</h4>
			<p>Either report it to us via one of the avenues listed at the bottom of the page or, if you have web dev experience, try fixing it yourself by forking our Github.</p>

		<div class="faqCard">
			<h4>I have another question that’s not answered here?</h4>
			<p>Feel free to reach out via the contact information listed at the bottom of the page and ask me!</p>

			<h4>Is the FaQ over yet? Can I see the groups now?</h4>
			<p>Fine.</p>

		<p >While we, The Homestuck Green Pages, have collected these groups and I, BattleblockB0ss, have reviewed each group, please keep in mind that <b>we cannot guarantee their safety.</b> We have not performed in-depth investigations of any link or organization listed on this page. Many - if not all - active groups host IRL meetups, so please be careful and keep your safety in mind above all else. To share a personal anecdote relating to Homestuck group safety: during the peak days of Homestuck there was a thriving Homestuck culture in my city. One person led most of the efforts and meetups that occured, and was regarded as a bit of a "con mom" by many. Unfortunately it eventually came out that she was a pedophile and had sexually assaulted multiple underage cosplayers on multiple occasions. Her betrayal of the community's trust killed off Homestuck activity for years, and more importantly, hurt people irreparably. The moral of the story? Be careful, and nobody is above suspicion. That said, enjoy the project.</p>
